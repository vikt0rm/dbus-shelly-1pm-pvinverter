# dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter
Integrate Shelly 1PM into Victron Energies Venus OS

## Purpose
With the scripts in this repo it should be easy possible to install, uninstall, restart a service that connects the Shelly 1PM to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.
Idea is inspired on @fabian-lauer project linked below.



## Inspiration
This project is my first on GitHub and with the Victron Venus OS, so I took some ideas and approaches from the following projects - many thanks for sharing the knowledge:
- https://github.com/fabian-lauer/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter
- https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/gen1/#shelly1-shelly1pm
- https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/dbus#pv-inverters

## How it works
### My setup
- 3-Phase installation
- Shelly 1PM with latest firmware (20220209-094317/v1.11.8-g8c7bb8d)
  - Measuring AC output of SUN-2000 GTIL on phase L3
  - Connected to Wifi netowrk "A" with a known IP  
- Shelly 1PM with latest firmware (20220209-094317/v1.11.8-g8c7bb8d)
  - Measuring AC output of Envertech EVT-500 and Hoymiles HM-800 on phase L3
  - Connected to Wifi netowrk "A" with a known IP  
- Shelly 3EM used as a grid meter
  - Connected over https://github.com/fabian-lauer/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter
  - Connected to Wifi netowrk "A" with a known IP  
- Venus OS on Raspberry PI 4 4GB version 1.1 - Firmware v2.84
  - No other devices from Victron connected
  - Connected to Wifi netowrk "A"

### Details / Process
As mentioned above the script is inspired by @fabian-lauer dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter implementation.
So what is the script doing:
- Running as a service
- connecting to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.pvinverter.http_{DeviceInstanceID_from_config}`
- After successful DBus connection Shelly 1PM is accessed via REST-API - simply the /status is called and a JSON is returned with all details
  A sample JSON file from Shelly 1PM can be found [here](docs/shelly1pm-status-sample.json)
- Serial/MAC is taken from the response as device serial
- Paths are added to the DBus with default value 0 - including some settings like name, etc
- After that a "loop" is started which pulls Shelly 1PM data every 750ms from the REST-API and updates the values in the DBus

Thats it üòÑ

## Install & Configuration
### Get the code
Just grap a copy of the main branche and copy them to a folder under `/data/` e.g. `/data/dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter`.
After that call the install.sh script.

The following script should do everything for you:
```
wget https://github.com/vikt0rm/dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter-main /data/dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter
chmod a+x /data/dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter/install.sh
/data/dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter/install.sh
rm main.zip
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Check configuration after that - because service is already installed an running and with wrong connection data (host, username, pwd) you will spam the log-file

### Change config.ini
Within the project there is a file `/data/dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter/config.ini` - just change the values - most important is the deviceinstance, custom name and phase under "DEFAULT" and host, username and password in section "ONPREMISE". More details below:

| Section  | Config vlaue | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DEFAULT  | AccessType | Fixed value 'OnPremise' |
| DEFAULT  | SignOfLifeLog  | Time in minutes how often a status is added to the log-file `current.log` with log-level INFO |
| DEFAULT  | Deviceinstance | Unique ID identifying the shelly 1pm in Venus OS |
| DEFAULT  | CustomName | Name shown in Remote Console (e.g. name of pv inverter) |
| DEFAULT  | Phase | Valid values L1, L2 or L3: represents the phase where pv inverter is feeding in |
| DEFAULT  | Position | Valid values 0, 1 or 2: represents where the inverter is connected (0=AC input 1; 1=AC output; 2=AC input 2) |
| DEFAULT  | RefreshRate | Valid values are above 250: Refresh rate for timer in ms |
| ONPREMISE  | Host | IP or hostname of on-premise Shelly 3EM web-interface |
| ONPREMISE  | Username | Username for htaccess login - leave blank if no username/password required |
| ONPREMISE  | Password | Password for htaccess login - leave blank if no username/password required |
